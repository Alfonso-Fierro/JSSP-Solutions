# Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) Solver

Welcome to the JSSP Solver project! This repository contains a comprehensive solution to the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) using a multi-stage approach. The solution is structured into the following key stages:

## Stages of the Solution

1. **Problem Formalization**
   - **File**: `Formalización del problema.pdf`
   - **Description**: This document provides a detailed formalization of the JSSP, including the mathematical formulation and constraints.

2. **Initial Solutions**
   - **Folder**: `Soluciones Iniciales`
   - **Description**: Contains initial feasible solutions to the problem. These solutions serve as the starting point for further optimization.

3. **Local Search**
   - **Folder**: `Búsqueda Local`
   - **Description**: Implements local search techniques to improve the initial solutions. This stage focuses on exploring the neighborhood of solutions to find better schedules.

4. **Metaheuristics**
   - **Folder**: `Metaheurísticos`
   - **Description**: Utilizes advanced metaheuristic algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms to optimize the solutions further. This stage aims to find the global optimum by avoiding local optima.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jssp-solver.git
   cd jssp-solver
   ```

2. **Review the formalization document**: Start by understanding the problem through the `Formalización del problema.pdf`.

3. **Explore initial solutions**: Check the `Soluciones Iniciales` folder for starting solutions.

4. **Run local search**: Navigate to the `Búsqueda Local` folder to run local search algorithms on the initial solutions.

5. **Apply metaheuristics**: Finally, use the `Metaheurísticos` folder to apply metaheuristic algorithms and obtain the optimized solution.
